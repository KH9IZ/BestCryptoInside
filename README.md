### Small story
After some practice, in 2018, friend, who [showed me bots](https://github.com/KH9IZ/translator), asked me to help him realize one feature in one of his projects.
It was my first payed job. And a couple of months later he offered me to work under this project. 

Before me there was one more programmer, who has wroten a big part of code (but later I had to rewrite all). 
Ok, some times later we end-up this project. And all what we need to do is sometimes made corrections in code by requesting of customer.

Year later (in autumn 2018) the guy, who made a business in our team, just has given this project to me. 
It means now I needed to solve all problems and also have 6 dollars per month (for maintaining the bot's performance). So I found that the code wroten me about 1-2 years later looks so bad. And after many troubles with bot I made a desision to reorgonize whole structure of bot.
After my changings all started work properly. 

Unfortunately, in end of 2019 the man, who ordered this bot decided to close project. So now it is just a repository in my GitHub account

### Overview
During all reorganisations this project has many repositories, so now I have only two commits showing difference after my reorganization and befor it.
It is my longest project in maintaining.
